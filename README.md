# Google Book Search

## What is “Google Book Search” ?

"Google Book Search" is a MERN (Mongo, Express, React.js, Node.js)-based webapp that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save them for future use. This was built primary to practice making apps that utilized the MERN stack and to improve my knowledge of making a full stack application. 

## Functionality/Usage

1. Upon loading, the user will see a search bar that allows them to search for books.
2. After searching, the app will search Google Books for the input title or author, and generate a list of results. 
3. The user can then view the individual results by clicking the "view" button, or saving them to the website by pressing "save".
4. If there are saved books in the database, any user can see the previous list of saved books by clicking the "saved" tab on the top of the page.
